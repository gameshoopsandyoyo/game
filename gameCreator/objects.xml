  <!--Notes:
  - Some stuff were rescripted on Frame 0 (where it calls the xml and its core contents) 
    and i estimated what code was with ids, types and etc.
  - Online functionality is unavailable as its redirecting to games.hoopsandyoyo.com/gameCreator/ which doesn't exist.
    According to Cyan (piddles.net), the game functioned via Microsoft ASP.NET (.ashx files).
    You can however make this work by inserting basic pre-built levels on the .ashx files if you modify the SWF file to be just ("loadGames.ashx")
    instead of ("https://games.hoopsandyoyo.com/gameCreator/loadGames.ashx")
  - Balloon Decoy, Treat Table and Office Cubicle aren't 100% working as the Balloon and Treat doesnt have animations yet, while Cubicle unloads itself
    and makes the points go NaN while collision data is still intact
  - Descriptions are estimated guesses. they arent 100% accurate except for Eraser which has built-in description in the SWF.
  - This also applies to points which are also guesses.
  - Is "coffeePot" ever used?
  - Everything was rescripted by DanielSWF. Don't try to claim as your own, as you dont even probably have any knowledge in XML.
  - If you'd like to ask me if you want this onto your site, contact me on "danielswf" on Discord.
